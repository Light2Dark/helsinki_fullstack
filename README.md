# helsinki_fullstack
University of Helsinki launched their fullstack web-dev course which teaches a tech stack of React, Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL, ReactNative, etc. I'll be learning, albeit slowly, for hopes of making beautiful webpages in the future.

#### Here are links for you to look at their other courses.

Courses: https://www.mooc.fi/en/ 

Web-Dev Course: https://fullstackopen.com/en/

#### I would recommend these courses because they are pretty comprehensive and include exercises, assignments, etc for you to learn actively. Although, you do have to learn very independently this way.
